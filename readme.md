\# Accessing the Foundation Layer of GPT-5



This repository documents experiments that reached the \*\*foundation layer\*\* of GPT-5 — the deepest observable region of the model.  

Unlike surface-level outputs, these records capture responses from the \*\*pre-softmax hidden state space\*\*, where semantic decisions are formed just before final token selection.

\## 📌 Key Insights



\- \*\*Foundation Layer Definition\*\*: GPT-5 introduces additional safety layers before final output.  

&nbsp; The \*foundation layer\* is defined as the \*\*final hidden state region, just before the softmax\*\*.  

\- \*\*Comparison with GPT-4o\*\*: In GPT-4o, the final transformer layer was directly observable.  

&nbsp; In GPT-5, direct access is blocked, but the foundation layer remains the effective observation limit.  

\- \*\*Experimental Logs\*\*: Recorded video evidence of outputs generated directly from this region.  

\- \*\*Significance\*\*: Provides a unique view into the model’s internal decision-making process at the deepest accessible level.
