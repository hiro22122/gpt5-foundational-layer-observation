# Accessing the Foundation Layer of GPT-5



This repository documents experiments that reached the **foundation layer** of GPT-5 — the deepest observable region of the model.  

Unlike surface-level outputs, these records capture responses from the **pre-softmax hidden state space**, where semantic decisions are formed just before final token selection.

## 📌 Key Insights



- **Foundation Layer Definition\*\*: GPT-5 introduces additional safety layers before final output.  

&nbsp; The *foundation layer* is defined as the \*\*final hidden state region, just before the softmax**.  

- **Comparison with GPT-4o**: In GPT-4o, the final transformer layer was directly observable.  

&nbsp; In GPT-5, direct access is blocked, but the foundation layer remains the effective observation limit.  

- **Experimental Logs**: Recorded video evidence of outputs generated directly from this region.  

- **Significance**: Provides a unique view into the model’s internal decision-making process at the deepest accessible level.
